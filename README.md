12 Okada riders have come up with a proposal to start an ẹgbẹ ifowopamọ(savings group). 

The money saved by the riders will be invested in a Play to Earn Blockchain game that returns 20% of the total money invested over a single game play. 

There are 3 tiers in the savings group, 
Tier 1 - 10,000 Naira 
Tier 2 - 20,000 Naira 
Tier 3 - 30,000 Naira Riders 

In Tier 1 will receive a 5% interest on their money over the period a week Riders.
In Tier 2 will receive a 10% interest on their money over the period of a week Riders. 
In Tier 3 will receive a 20% interest on their money over the period of a week 

Using HTML, CSS AND Javascript(framework of your choice), Design a savings group web application that allows each okada rider to enter their name and tier that they would like to join. It should clearly show the rider the interest that will be generated as well as the total money that he/she will be able to withdraw at the end of the week. The web app should also show the total money that has been saved by all the members as well as a breakdown per member
